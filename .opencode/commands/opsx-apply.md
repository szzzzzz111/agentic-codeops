description: Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change (Experimental)

Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `/opsx-apply add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx-apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID -> array of concrete file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using `/opsx-continue`
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Run the stage-authority preflight**

   After activation, run `scripts/validate_stage_authority.py` with
   `--required-action implement` and the exact flags documented in
   `.harness/test_commands.md` before the first implementation mutation. The
   host must supply exact expected stage, epoch, record hash, risk, scope
   digest, planning base, action ceiling, remote name, effective fetch/push endpoint
   fingerprints, target branch, and authorized remote tip retained from the
   live direct-user confirmation; never copy them from the record being
   validated. Missing/stale/insufficient authority, lineage or expected-input
   mismatch, and scope/path drift are hard stops. PASS is mechanical-only and
   does not establish live human authority.

   Stage-change replay is dormant and non-authorizing until a later reviewed
   host activation proves `provider_neutral.stage_state_cas/v1`. This
   introducing stage and all stages already in flight remain pre-change v1
   cohorts through terminal, including later-v1 authority replacement for
   owner-bound drift. A repository hash, fixture, CLI boolean, or shadow replay
   PASS cannot select v2 or authorize/block apply.

   For a future host-activated v2 cohort only, authority core runs before
   replay and the controller supplies immutable workspace/terminal/gate
   snapshots plus exact retained event/receipt counts and heads. Implement may
   mutate only at the exact `implementation` frontier; earlier/later or
   "unaffected" actions fail before mutation.

6. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

7. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

8. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

### Completed This Session
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
...

All tasks complete! You can archive this change with `/opsx-archive`.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered
<description of the issue>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names
- After activation, do not warning-and-continue around the shared `implement`
  authority gate
- Keep replay dormant for v1 cohorts; after a real v2 host activation, require
  exact-frontier equality and host-retained lineage with no unaffected bypass
- Merge and push remain controller-only actions under `repo-stage-workflow`

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
